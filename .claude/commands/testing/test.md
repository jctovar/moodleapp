# Run Tests

Run all Jest tests in the project once.

This will:
- Execute all test files (*.test.ts and *.spec.ts)
- Show test results and coverage summary
- Report any test failures
- Exit when complete

For continuous testing, use `/test-watch` instead.
For coverage report, use `/test-coverage`.
