# Run Tests in Watch Mode

Run Jest tests in watch mode. Tests automatically re-run when you save files.

This will:
- Watch all test files for changes
- Re-run affected tests on save
- Show real-time results
- Help with TDD workflow

Press `q` to quit watch mode.

For running tests once, use `/test` instead.
